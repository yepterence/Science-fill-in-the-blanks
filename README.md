The user will be prompted to input a difficulty level (easy, medium or hard) of the quiz and will then attempt to answer the question.
Every attempt will be checked against the answer bank. If the answer is correct, the answer will replace the blank, and then the user will answer the next blank that follows. 
However, if the answer is wrong - the question will be prompted again 3 more times and the user is given another chance to answer the question. If the user cannot answer the question, it moves on to the next blank.

Have fun!
